This is your new Textbook Exchange project!
=====================================

## Installing Play
In order to setup the Textbook-Exchange project you first want to install the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0/Installing). 

## Configuring Play for Eclipse
The developers of Play made it easy to configure any Play project for IDE's such as Eclipse. Follow the steps to [configure](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.0/IDE) a play Project for Eclipse.

## Downloading and importing the Textbook-Exchange Project into Eclipse
Download and extract the Textbook-Exchange project into your play directory. You need to then import the project into Eclipse. To import the application into your Eclipse workspace go to **File/Import/General/Existing Project...** and choose the TextbookExchange folder you downloaded as the root directory.

## Enabling EBean
In order to enable EBean for the application, we uncommented the lines below in the application.conf file.
* db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
* db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
* db.default.user=sa
* db.default.password=""
* ebean.default="models.*"

Under Evolutions we also added the line:
* applyEvolutions.default=true

## Running the application in Play
In order to run the application, we need to open a terminal/command line window.  Enter the directory where you installed Play.  Next, enter the TextbookExchange directory where you extracted the TextbookExchange project. Open the play console by typing the command $play.  Next, we can run the TextBookExchangeModelTest.java file by running the command $test.

## Editing the application
You can make changes to the entities in our application in Eclipse.  The 4 entity classes are held in the TextbookExchange>app>models package. Changes can also be made to out test class in TextbookExchangeModelTest.java file in the TextbookExchange>app>test package. Once changes are made, you can easily run your new test class by re-running the play console and test command. To exit the current play console from the command line simply type CTRL+D. 


## About the TextbookExchange data model
The TextbookExchange data model allows students of a university to offer and request textbooks from other students.  Each student can make multiple offers and requests if he or shes wishes.  Each instance of an offer/request can be associated with only one textbook and belong to a single student.

4 entities:
1. Student
2. Book
3. Offer
4. Request
