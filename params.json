{"name":"Textbook-exchange","tagline":"Textbook Exchange project in Play","body":"## Welcome to Textbook Exchange Project!\r\nThe Textbook Exchange application allows students of a university to exchange textbooks with one another.   \r\n\r\nEach student must submit his or her name and school email.  Every student can make multiple offers to sell a textbook as well as multiple requests to buy a textbook.  Each offer includes the offering student's information, book details, current condition of the book, and targeted price to sell the book.  Each request includes the requesting student's information, book details, desired condition of book, and desired price to pay for the book.  Every book has a set of details to describe it which include: name, edition, ISBN number, and the price of a brand new book from the bookstore. \r\n\r\n## About Textbook-Exchange Data Model\r\n![Textbook-Exchange](https://raw.github.com/kcanida/Textbook-Exchange/master/images/TextbookExchangeDataModel.png)\r\n\r\n##Working Parts of Textbook Exchange web application\r\nThe Textbook Exchange application is not completely functional at this point in time.
